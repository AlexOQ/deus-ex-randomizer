# deus-ex-randomizer

Copy the DeusEx.u file into your Deus Ex\System\ folder, which is probably C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deus Ex\System

Recommended to use it with Kentie's Deus Exe Launcher, or Han's Launcher

Currently in v1.3, DXRando randomizes the exp costs for skills, changing the locations of items/boxes/NanoKeys around the map, randomizing passwords and passcodes, changing the locations of datacubes, changing what augmentations are in each canister, and randomly adding and changing enemies. You can also reduce the drop rate for ammo, multitools, lockpicks, medkits, and bioelectric cells. There are also settings for starting the game with the running speed augmentation, autosave, removing invisible walls, making all doors that normally require a key also lockpickable/destructible, and making all keypads hackable.

For the randomized passwords, you can copy-paste from the Goals/Notes screen.
