# Deus Ex Randomizer

This is a mod for the original Deus Ex that takes everything and shuffles it all around to make it like a new game every time but with the same great story.

### Installation Instructions

Download the `DeusEx.u` file from the releases page here https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/releases

Then copy the `DeusEx.u` file into your `Deus Ex\System\` folder, which is probably `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deus Ex\System` (make a backup of the original `DeusEx.u`)

### Currently in v1.5.6, DXRando randomizes
* locations of goals, NPCs, and some starting locations
* medbots and repair bots (with hint datacubes near them)
* adding and moving turrets, cameras, security computers, and datacubes for them
* starting equipment, bioelectric energy, and credits
* adding and changing characters, giving them random names and making some of them dance
* changing the locations of items/boxes/NanoKeys/datacubes around the map
* passwords and passcodes (they get updated in your Goals/Notes screen)
* exp costs for skills
    * option for rerolling every mission
    * option for disabling the Downgrade button on the new game screen, to prevent looking ahead
* what augmentations are in each canister
* the strength and lockpick strength for doors
* the hack strength for keypads
* the strength of augmentations and skills
* the damage and firing speed of weapons
* JC's and Paul's clothes
* randomly adds "The Merchant"

There are also settings for
* Crowd Control! Let your viewers troll you or help you! NOW PLAYABLE! https://forum.warp.world/t/deus-ex-randomizer-pc/20496
    * If you want to try some of the Crowd Control features without actually streaming, you can try the "OfflineCrowdControl.py" script to randomly send Crowd Control messages to your local game!  Requires Python 3.8 or above
* New Game+ - after beating the game play it again keeping your items, skills, and augs, but with increased difficulty and a new seed
* new game modes!
    * Rearranged Levels is in beta, it changes what level each teleporter takes you to, but keeps it within the same mission.
    * Horde Mode is in beta and mostly I think it just needs balancing.
* challenge mode loadouts!
    * Stick With the Prod means the only weapon you get is the stun prod (hint: throw a crate straight up into the air to break it)
        * Stick With the Prod Plus also allows EMP grenades, gas grenades, scramble grenades, pepper gun, and tranq darts
    * Ninja JC - the only weapons allowed are thowing knives and the sword, you get a Ninja Augmentation which gives you speed and stealth at the same time
    * Don't Give Me the GEP Gun - bans the GEP gun
    * Freeman Mode - only weapon allowed is the crowbar
    * Grenades Only
* making all or some of the doors that normally require a key also lockpickable and/or destructible
* making all or some keypads hackable.
* reducing the drop rate for ammo, multitools, lockpicks, medkits, and bioelectric cells
* autosave
* making enemies respawn
* starting the game with the running speed augmentation
* optional hardcore Autosave-Only mode, no save-scumming allowed!

For the randomized passwords, you can copy-paste from the Goals/Notes screen.

I've also made some balance tweaks. Make sure to read the descriptions for skills and augmentations. Hacking computers now uses bioelectric energy. The large metal crates are now destructible, they have 2000 hp. Spy Drone aug has improved speed and the emp blast now also does explosive damage. The PS20 has been upgraded to the PS40 and does significantly more damage. Paul is now mortal during the raid in mission 4, so you need to help him fight! Hazmat suit now also helps against fire, electricity, and explosions. Enviro skill now gives a little passive damage resistance for the same damage types as Hazmat suits. Demolition skill allows you to carry more grenades at once. Items like ballistic armor and rebreathers now free up the inventory space immediately when you equip them.

### Recommended tweaks for running Deus Ex on modern computers

Recommended to use it with [Kentie's Deus Exe Launcher](http://www.kentie.net/article/dxguide/), or [Han's Launcher](https://coding.hanfling.de/launch/#binaries). Play with OpenGL renderer because the Direct3D renderers have trouble on newer Nvidia drivers unless you use the [Deus Ex Speedup Fix mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2048525175). The [Deus Ex Speedup Fix mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2048525175) allows you to disable the fps cap (the fps cap in the game can cause stutters, but capping frame rate in nvidia control panel works perfectly) If you use that mod, then edit your `Documents\Deus Ex\System\DeusEx.ini` file and search for `FPSLimit=` and set it to 0 to manually remove the fps cap because I've noticed that Kentie's Launcher doesn't always do it correctly, and also disable vsync with your graphics driver. If you use the speedup fix then you'll probably want to use the [Direct3D 10](https://kentie.net/article/d3d10drv/) or [Direct3D 11](https://kentie.net/article/d3d11drv/index.htm) renderer.
