# Deus Ex Randomizer

This is a mod for the original Deus Ex that takes everything and shuffles it all around to make it like a new game every time but with the same great story. The goal is to increase the replayability and strategy.

### If the game is not running well, even for vanilla Deus Ex, see the recommended tweaks below.

## Installation Instructions
<details>

Download the `DeusEx.u` file from the releases page here https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/releases

Then copy the `DeusEx.u` file into your `Deus Ex\System\` folder, which is probably `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deus Ex\System` (make a backup of the original `DeusEx.u`).

Download Lay D Denton version 1.1 from here https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-lay-d-denton-project

Install Lay D Denton by copying all the files into your Deus Ex folder.

Download Deus Ex Randomizers's `DeusEx.u` file from the releases page here https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/releases

Then copy Deus Ex Randomizers's `DeusEx.u` file into your `Deus Ex\System\` folder, which is probably `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deus Ex\System`. This will overwrite the `DeusEx.u` file from Lay D Denton.

## Installation Instructions for HX (Co-op)
<details>
<summary>Click to expand...</summary>

Make sure to use the DeusEx.u file from the original game for co-op.

First download and install HX-0.9.89.4.zip from https://builds.hx.hanfling.de/testing/

Then copy `HXRandomizer.u` and `HXRandomizer.int` into the `System` directory of the game.

HXRandomizer is in early alpha testing and does not support all of the features that the single player vanilla randomizer has.

## Balance Chances

Hacking computers now uses bioelectric energy. The light augmentation no longer uses energy. The large metal crates are now destructible, they have 2000 hp. Spy Drone aug has improved speed and the emp blast now also does explosive damage. The PS20 has been upgraded to the PS40 and does significantly more damage. Paul is now mortal during the raid in mission 4, so you need to help him fight! Hazmat suit now also helps against fire, electricity, and explosions. Enviro skill now gives a little passive damage resistance for the same damage types as Hazmat suits. Demolition skill allows you to carry more grenades at once. Items like ballistic armor and rebreathers now free up the inventory space immediately when you equip them. Alcohol now gives you some energy and also fixes dead legs.

## Recommended tweaks for running Deus Ex on modern computers
<details>
<summary>Click to expand...</summary>

Recommended to use it with [Kentie's Deus Exe Launcher](http://www.kentie.net/article/dxguide/), or [Han's Launcher](https://coding.hanfling.de/launch/#binaries). Play with OpenGL renderer because the Direct3D renderers have trouble on newer Nvidia drivers unless you use the [Deus Ex Speedup Fix mod. The Deus Ex Speedup Fix mod (download at the bottom of linked page)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2048525175) allows you to disable the fps cap (the fps cap in the game can cause stutters, but capping frame rate in nvidia control panel works perfectly) If you use that mod, then edit your `Documents\Deus Ex\System\DeusEx.ini` file and search for `FPSLimit=` and set it to 0 to manually remove the fps cap because I've noticed that Kentie's Launcher doesn't always do it correctly, and also disable vsync with your graphics driver. If you use the speedup fix then you'll probably want to use the [Direct3D 10](https://kentie.net/article/d3d10drv/) or [Direct3D 11](https://kentie.net/article/d3d11drv/index.htm) renderer. I use my graphics driver to enforce a 120fps limit with Direct3D 10.
