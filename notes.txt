Needed this to run UnrealEd http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb50pro/utility/1/win98/EN-US/Msvbvm50.exe

X start with running speed aug, at max level? max level is too OP
X don't give 2 of the same aug in a canister
rename test function
organize the fixes for individual levels
X fix skill cost generation
X log statements
X don't swap actor with itself
maybe set the seed inside the foreach AllActors loop to keep it more stable?
need a function for GiveRandomItem()
need a function for CloneNanoKey() (based on Engine.Pickup.SpawnCopy? no, that's for respawning items)
need to figure out how to modify conversations, datacubes, emails...

ambrosia in battery park, maybe I should never move ambrosia?
key to bathroom in mole tunnel 03_NYC_MolePeople seems to be the only way to progress? maybe modify the properties on the door to make it breakable and lockpickable?
there are no items to swap with past the door, but it maybe be possible for the key to be attempted to be placed in a bad area? maybe I should copy the key into the NSF leader's inventory so you can always kill him for it? or can I modify his dialog so that he just gives you the key?
the key name is NanoKey0, KeyID is MoleRestroomKey, the door name is DeusExMover65

I can use this for string hashing http://www.unrealtexture.com/Unreal/Downloads/3DEditing/UnrealEd/Tutorials/unrealwiki-offline/crc32.html

maybe I can rewrite this as a mutator?

unrealscript gui:
seed, skill cost %s, starting points, ammo %, lockpick %, multitool %, money %, bioelectric cells %, health%, base movement speed %? falling damage %? passcodes and passwords
can I improve ladders just make them super sticky and press jump to get off?
