for v1.2========================

I think passwords might not be remembered across levels

start randomizing enemies? only add enemies?

fix password generation for 14_VANDENBERG_SUB
- do longest passwords first for safe replacements (actually no point, cause they can come in different orders as levels load and notes get found)
- check if the match on the password is touching a letter or number
- does every note that references a password have a tag? I should log it

print out the flags when loading

autosave
- MenuScreenSaveGame
- DeusExSaveInfo

NavigationPoint (children: PathNode, PatrolPoint, AmbushPoint, InventorySpot) for extra positions where items can be placed?
    - Pawn class - native(518) final function Actor FindPathTo(vector aPoint, optional bool bSinglePath, 
												optional bool bClearPaths);
    - Pawn class - native(517) final function Actor FindPathToward(actor anActor, optional bool bSinglePath, 
												optional bool bClearPaths);
    I can use FindPath to determine if I can do a key swap? find path from key to path in question, walk through the NavigationPoints and see if the door is in between any of them?
    -what does this do? native(525) final function NavigationPoint FindRandomDest(optional bool bClearPaths);
        -FindRandomDest - This returns a random node on the navigation network. This can be good for creating a state where the character roams the world.
    -I could find all the NavigationPoints within a small radius of the door, and whichever ones are farther from the key than the door is are bad points that should indicate a failed path finding
        -should this be done in a preparation loop, or while doing the pathfinding?
    
can I randomize the location of datacubes? would be hard without being able to check the text inside them, could just detect all the possible devices/computers with codes and make sure it's safe for all of them
    
native(533) final function bool CanSee(actor Other);

Keypoint, the base class of invisible actors which mark things.
    -LocationID - marks and names an area in a zone

// WarpZoneInfo. For making disjoint spaces appear as if they were connected;
// supports both in-level warp zones and cross-level warp zones.

I can use helper classes that inherit from Object instead of Actor
=============================

need a function for GiveRandomItem()
need a function for CloneNanoKey() (based on Engine.Pickup.SpawnCopy? no, that's for respawning items)
need to figure out how to modify conversations, datacubes, emails...
x should meme up the endings too (more?)

AI hearing and vision adjustment, enemy health
rando dragoon's tooth sword? nerf it?
actor class also has these:
    var const Actor           Base;          // Moving brush actor we're standing on.
    native(298) final function SetBase( actor NewBase );
    var const PointRegion     Region;        // Region this actor is in.
    var(Collision) const bool bCollideActors;   // Collides with other actors.
    var(Collision) bool       bCollideWorld;    // Collides with the world.
    var(Collision) bool       bBlockActors;	    // Blocks other nonplayer actors.
    var(Collision) bool       bBlockPlayers;    // Blocks other player actors.

exploded corpses drop keys?
bIsItemGoal?
should NanoKeys have buoyancy?
what does minDamageThreshold do for doors? important doors shouldn't be breakable by the dragoon's tooth
-cameras have a minDamageThreshold of 50

x I can use this for string hashing http://www.unrealtexture.com/Unreal/Downloads/3DEditing/UnrealEd/Tutorials/unrealwiki-offline/crc32.html

maybe I can rewrite this as a mutator?
